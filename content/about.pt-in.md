Hey there!
My name is Pranjal Verma. I am currently a postgrad student of **Masters of Computer Application** (freshman) at [**Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya, Indore**](http://www.scs.dauniv.ac.in/). I've completed my **Bachelor's** from **Integral University, Lucknow**. At the moment I don't have a lot of work experience, but I'm slowly accumulating it. Here are my [projects]({{<ref "project.md">}}) and [resume]({{<ref "resume.md">}}).

## SKILLS

I'm familiar with each of the listed skills, even if the main one is **C++** and **Python**. As you can see for now I am specialized in programming, therefore I am a *developer*. And also, enhancing my problem solving skills day by day.
