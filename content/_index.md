I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at **Accenture, Pune**, where I focus on building
production-grade machine learning systems and distributed data pipelines. Prior to this, I worked as a
Software Engineer at **Walkover, Indore**, where I contributed to the development of high-performance
web applications and microservices supporting large-scale business operations.  

I received my Master’s degree in Computer Applications (MCA) from **Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya,
Indore** in 2024, and my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications (BCA) from **Integral University,
Lucknow** in 2022.  

My work mainly revolves around **MLOps, distributed systems, and scalable machine learning
infrastructure**. In particular, I am interested in automating ML pipelines, optimizing model serving
and inference, and designing cloud-native architectures that enable reliable, cost-efficient, and
high-performance AI systems.  

Beyond professional work, I also enjoy exploring **large language models, generative AI, multimodal
systems, and open-source contributions**, with a strong interest in bridging research and industry for
production-ready AI applications.
